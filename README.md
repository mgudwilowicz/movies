# 🎬 Movies Database — Python Project

A simple command-line application for managing a personal movie database.  
All movie information is stored in a JSON file named **data.json**, which serves as the project’s lightweight database.

The application relies on helper functions located in **movie_storage.py**, responsible for:

- Loading movie data from the JSON file  
- Saving updated data back to the file  
- Adding, deleting, and modifying movie entries  

These functions handle all reading and writing operations, allowing the main program to interact only with clean Python dictionaries — keeping the logic simple and organized.
